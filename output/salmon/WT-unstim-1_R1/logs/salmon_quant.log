[2019-11-11 11:27:22.996] [jointLog] [info] Computed 801 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-11 11:27:22.996] [jointLog] [info] Counted 19541 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-11 11:27:22.997] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00784434% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-11-11 11:27:22.998] [jointLog] [warning] Only 19541 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
